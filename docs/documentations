1. Project vision 
1.1. Backgrounds - We will build a weather station station using a Raspberry PI. We will use external sensor input and pull weather data from the internet. The PI station will give accurate weather readings and send alerts based on data from either the sensors or the web to the users.
1.2. Socio-economic Impact, Business Objectives, and Gap Analysis -
